                    <h2>Designer Bio</h2>
                    <p>Ruby has always been drawn to work which combines hands-on, technical labor with artistic expression, and has found a perfect balance between these forces in the art of garment design and construction. Her interest in style began when she moved from her hometown of Toronto, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec, where she spent years working with vintage clothing alongside friends who inspired her to develop a distinct personal aesthetic and taught her about the joy of self-expression. Though she stumbled into Minneapolis College’s Apparel Technologies program almost by accident, she’s extremely grateful to have gotten the opportunity to hone a new set of skills which seem to magically align with her passions and interests. Ruby is excited to see where this degree leads her and hopes to be able to continue living in Minneapolis, the city of her dreams.</p>

                    <p>It’s possible that the objects we lose or let go of disappear for a reason; that they’re meant to run away and lead new lives. My collection, “Cedar Chest,” provides one possible next chapter to this kind of story: it uses exclusively thrifted and found fabric, giving new life to old materials. I source my materials from thrift store bins, yard sales, front stoops, and my friend’s parent’s basements, allowing the fabric to dictate the direction in which each design moves. The designs are then developed with an aesthetic inspired by the organic shapes and vibrant colors of the gardens I’ve worked in, and the variety of textures and prints in the vintage clothing I’ve been surrounded by. With this collection, I explore the potential hidden within forgotten or discarded items, hoping to create garments which provide a joyful next chapter for both the fabric and the person who wears it.</p>
